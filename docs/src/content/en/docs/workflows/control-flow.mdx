# Control Flow

When you build a workflow, you typically break down operations into smaller tasks that can be linked and reused. **Steps** provide a structured way to manage these tasks by defining inputs, outputs, and execution logic.

- If the schemas match, the `outputSchema` from each step is automatically passed to the `inputSchema` of the next step.
- If the schemas don't match, use [Input data mapping](./input-data-mapping.mdx) to transform the `outputSchema` into the expected `inputSchema`.

## Sequential

Chain steps to execute in sequence using `.then()`:

```typescript {8-9,4-5} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```

## Parallel

Execute steps in parallel using `.parallel()`:

```typescript {8,4-5} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .parallel([step1, step2])
  .commit();
```

This executes all steps in the array concurrently, then continues to the next step after all parallel steps complete.

> See [Parallel Execution with Steps](/examples/workflows/parallel-steps) for more information.

## Branch

Create conditional branches using `.branch()`:

**!Workflows branch /image/workflows/workflows-branch.jpg**

```typescript {8-11,4-5} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const lessThanStep = createStep({...});
const greaterThanStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .branch([
    [async ({ inputData: { some_value } }) => some_value <= 9, lessThanStep],
    [async ({ inputData: { some_value } }) => some_value >= 10, greaterThanStep]
  ])
  .commit();
```

Branch conditions are evaluated sequentially, but steps with matching conditions are executed in parallel.

> See [Workflow with Conditional Branching](/examples/workflows/conditional-branching) for more information.

## Loops

Workflows support two types of loops. When looping a step, or any step-compatible construct like a nested workflow, the initial `inputData` is sourced from the output of the previous step.

To ensure compatibility, the loop’s initial input must either:

- Match the shape of the previous step’s output, or
- Be explicitly transformed using the `map` function.

### Dowhile

Executes a step repeatedly while a condition is true.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const counterStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .dowhile(counterStep, async ({ inputData: { number } }) => number < 10)
  .commit();
```

### Dountil

Executes a step repeatedly until a condition becomes true.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const counterStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .dountil(counterStep, async ({ inputData: { number } }) => number > 10)
  .commit();
```

### Foreach

Sequentially executes the same step for each item from the `inputSchema`.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const mapStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .foreach(mapStep)
  .commit();
```

#### Concurrency

Use `concurrency` to execute steps in parallel with a limit on the number of concurrent executions.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const mapStep = createStep({...})

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .foreach(mapStep, { concurrency: 2 })
  .commit();
```

## Nested Workflow

Use a nested workflow as a step by passing it to `.then()`. This runs each of its steps in sequence as part of the parent workflow.

```typescript {4,7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

export const nestedWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(nestedWorkflow)
  .commit();
```

## Clone Workflow

Use `cloneWorkflow` to duplicate an existing workflow. This lets you reuse its structure while overriding parameters like `id`.

```typescript {6,10} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep, cloneWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const parentWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
const clonedWorkflow = cloneWorkflow(parentWorkflow, { id: "cloned-workflow" });

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .then(clonedWorkflow)
  .commit();
```

## Bail

Use `bail()` in a step to exit early with a successful result. This returns the provided payload as the step output and ends workflow execution.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({
  id: 'step1',
  execute: async ({ bail }) => {
    return bail({ result: 'bailed' });
  },
  inputSchema: z.object({ value: z.string() }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ result: z.string() }),
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

### Error handling

Use `throw new Error()` in a step to exit with an error.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({
  id: 'step1',
  execute: async () => {
    throw new Error('bailed');
  },
  inputSchema: z.object({ value: z.string() }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ result: z.string() }),
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

This throws an error from the step and stops workflow execution, returning the error as the result.

## Example Run Instance

The following example demonstrates how to start a run with multiple inputs. Each input will pass through the `mapStep` sequentially.

```typescript {6} filename="src/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: [{ number: 10 }, { number: 100 }, { number: 200 }]
});
```

To execute this run from your terminal:

```bash copy
npx tsx src/test-workflow.ts
```
